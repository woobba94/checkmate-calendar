# Frontend Design Skill

This skill guides creation of **distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces** that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Core Approach

Before writing any code:

1. **Understand context** - purpose, audience, existing brand, technical constraints
2. **Commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction** - not just "clean and modern" but a specific, intentional style
3. **Execute with precision** - every element should reinforce the chosen direction

## Aesthetic Directions to Consider

Choose ONE and commit fully:

- **Brutally minimal** - Maximum whitespace, single accent color, typography-focused
- **Maximalist chaos** - Layered elements, rich textures, bold color clashes
- **Retro-futuristic** - Neon accents, dark backgrounds, sci-fi typography
- **Organic/natural** - Soft curves, earth tones, hand-drawn elements
- **Luxury/refined** - Subtle animations, premium typography, muted metallics
- **Playful/toy-like** - Rounded shapes, bright primaries, bouncy animations
- **Editorial/magazine** - Strong grid, dramatic type scale, photographic focus
- **Brutalist/raw** - Exposed structure, monospace fonts, anti-design elements
- **Art deco/geometric** - Bold geometry, gold accents, symmetrical patterns

## Typography Guidelines

**DO:**
- Choose fonts with character that match your aesthetic
- Create dramatic scale contrast (e.g., 72px headlines, 16px body)
- Use letter-spacing intentionally
- Consider variable fonts for dynamic expression

**DON'T:**
- Default to Inter, Roboto, or system fonts without reason
- Use more than 2-3 font families
- Ignore line-height and measure

## Color Guidelines

**DO:**
- Commit to a cohesive palette (3-5 colors max)
- Use one dominant color boldly
- Create sharp contrast where it matters
- Consider dark mode from the start

**DON'T:**
- Default to blue/purple gradients
- Use gray as a crutch
- Add colors "just because"

## Motion & Animation

**Prioritize high-impact moments:**
- Page load sequences
- Scroll-triggered reveals
- Hover state transformations
- Micro-interactions on key actions

**Keep it purposeful:**
- Every animation should feel intentional
- Match timing to your aesthetic (snappy for minimal, flowing for organic)
- Consider reduced-motion preferences

## Layout Principles

**Break the grid intentionally:**
- Asymmetric compositions
- Overlapping elements
- Diagonal flow
- Unexpected negative space

**But maintain coherence:**
- Consistent spacing system (8px base recommended)
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Responsive considerations from the start

## Detail & Polish

**Atmospheric elements:**
- Subtle gradients for depth
- Texture overlays for character
- Custom cursor styles
- Considered shadow systems

**Micro-details:**
- Custom selection colors
- Thoughtful focus states
- Loading state design
- Empty state design

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Generic hero sections with stock photos
❌ Bento grid layouts without purpose
❌ Gradient blobs as decoration
❌ "Clean and modern" as the entire direction
❌ Card-based layouts by default
❌ Purple/blue as automatic accent colors
❌ Animations that don't serve the content

## Implementation Notes

- Match code complexity to design complexity
- Elaborate animations require elaborate code
- Minimal designs require restrained, precise code
- Always consider performance impact
- Test across devices and screen sizes

## Quality Checklist

Before considering complete:

- [ ] Does this feel distinctive, not generic?
- [ ] Is the aesthetic direction clear and consistent?
- [ ] Do typography choices have character?
- [ ] Is color used boldly and intentionally?
- [ ] Do animations serve the design?
- [ ] Is the layout interesting but functional?
- [ ] Would this stand out in a portfolio?
